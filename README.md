# Welcome

Welcome to the Juju Big Data community repo. This serves as our hub for
hosting designs, blog posts, and (most importantly) information about how you
can get involved!

For an intro to our community, have a look at our [Getting Started][] post.
You'll find code, details about the Big Data solutions available in Juju, and
links to a few short videos describing some of our work. We periodically
update the main blog with new content about the Big Data ecosystem, so be
sure to check that out at [bigdata.juju.solutions][].
